# JPass - Password Manager 1.0.0-RELEASE

Overview
--------
JPass is a simple, small, portable password manager application with strong
encryption. It allows you to store user names, passwords, URLs and generic
notes in an encrypted file protected by one master password.

Features:

* Strong encryption - AES-256-CBC algorithm (PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA-256 is used as
  password-based key derivation function)
* Portable - single jar file which can be carried on a USB stick
* Built-in random password generator
* Organize all your user name, password, URL and notes information in one file
* Data import/export in XML format

Usage
-----
Java 8 or later is recommended to run JPass.
You can run the application from the command line by typing (the password
file is optional):

    java -jar jpass-1.0.0-RELEASE.jar [password_file]

For convenience, batch/shell scripts are also available for launching JPass
for various platforms (i.e. `jpass.bat` for Windows, `jpass.sh` for Linux,
`jpass.command` for macOS). Please make sure `PATH`, or `JAVA_HOME`
environment variables point to a valid Java installation.

Configuration
-------------
Default configurations can be overridden in `jpass.properties` file:

| Configuration key                  | Value type | Default value  |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| ui.theme.dark.mode.enabled         | boolean    | false          |
| clear.clipboard.on.exit.enabled    | boolean    | false          |
| default.password.generation.length | integer    | 14             |
| date.format                        | string     | yyyy-MM-dd     |
| entry.details                      | list       | TITLE,MODIFIED |
